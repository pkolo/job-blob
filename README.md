### Job Blob

Job Blob is a single-page web app that connects to the [Job Board API] (https://github.com/pkolo/job-board) to allow users to browse for gigs, or post new ones. It was created using `create-react-app`, and depends on the `aphrodite`, `lodash`, and `moment.js` libraries.

#### To install

Fork and clone the repo, `cd` into the directory, then `yarn install`. No configuration is required.

#### To run locally

Once installed, simply `yarn start`, and the app should be up and running.
